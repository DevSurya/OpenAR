    Apple's Rosy Writer example was also used as a reference.

### Changes

Modified, this code to suit my needs by remixing the original with some concepts from the Rosy Writer example, migrated it to ARC, dumped the struct BGRAVideoFrame in favor of OpenCV's Mat class. Fixed the byte ordering from BGR to RGB.
